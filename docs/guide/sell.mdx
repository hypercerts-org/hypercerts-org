### Who Can Sell a Hypercert?

Any creator of a hypercert can sell the hypercert or fractions of it. 

Owners who have received hypercert fractions from another creator cannot sell or transfer these fractions. Future releases may add additional functionalities to enable this under specific conditions.

### How Can I Sell a Hypercert?

Selling hypercerts is a simple and direct process. You can list a fraction of a hypercert you own for sale, set its price, and buyers will be able to purchase parts of your hypercert directly without intermediaries.

:::note  
When you sell a fraction, a 1% fee is allocated to the maintenance and improvement of the hypercerts protocol. If this fee is a concern for your project, we’re happy to work with you to find a solution. Feel free to contact us at [team@hypercerts.org](mailto:team@hypercerts.org).

## Step-by-Step Instructions

Make sure your wallet is connected before proceeding.

### Required Steps

1. **Find the hypercert**  
   Navigate to the hypercert you want to sell. You can find all hypercerts you own by clicking on "My hypercerts" in the menu. Open the hypercert you wish to sell.

2. **Open the listing pop-up**  
   Scroll down to the "Marketplace" section on the individual view page of the hypercert. Click the "List for sale" button to open a pop-up window.

3. **Select the fraction**  
   If you own multiple fractions of the same hypercert, select the specific fraction you want to list for sale.

4. **Set the price**  
   Enter the total price for the entire fraction. Prices for smaller fractions will be calculated proportionally.

   *Important:* Make sure to select the correct token (e.g. ETH, USDC, or DAI). Buyers will need to use this token to purchase.

If no advanced settings are required, click "Create listing," confirm the action in your wallet, and buyers will be able to purchase fractions of the hypercert you listed.

### Advanced Settings

5. **Set the units offered**  
   If you don’t want to sell the entire fraction, open the "Advanced Settings" and specify the number of units you want to offer for sale.

6. **Set minimum units per order**  
   If you want to require buyers to purchase at least a minimum number of units, define this amount here.

7. **Set maximum units per order**  
   If you want to limit buyers to a maximum number of units, define this amount here.  
   
   *Note:* Buyers could still make multiple transactions to purchase more of the hypercert.
