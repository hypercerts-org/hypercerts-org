### How Can I Buy a Hypercert?

Buying hypercerts is a simple and direct process. Once the owner has listed a hypercert fraction for sale and set the price, you can purchase it directly.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

Make sure your wallet is connected and that you are on the same blockchain network as the hypercert you want to buy.

### Required Steps

1. **Find the hypercert:**  
   Navigate to the <a href="https://app.hypercerts.org/explore?filter=evaluated&p=1" target="_blank">Explore Page</a> and select the hypercert you want to purchase.

2. **Locate available listings:**  
   On the hypercert’s individual page, scroll down to the "Marketplace" section. Here, you will find listed fractions of the hypercert available for purchase.

    <p style={{ marginTop: '6px', fontStyle: 'italic' }}>Marketplace listings to buy a hypercert</p>
    </div>

3. **Select a fraction:**  
   Choose the fraction you want to buy. Some fractions may have a minimum purchase amount and may differ in price.  
   
   *Note:* If the "Buy" button isn’t clickable, ensure your wallet is connected and that you are on the same blockchain network as the hypercert. Blockchain information is displayed below the hypercert title.

4. **Enter the number of units:**  
   Specify the number of units you wish to purchase. Your selection must fall within the seller’s minimum and maximum purchase limits.

    <p style={{ marginTop: '6px', fontStyle: 'italic' }}>Pop-up to buy a hypercert</p>
    </div>

5. **Review the price:**  
   Verify the price. You must at least meet the seller’s asking price to complete the purchase, but you can choose to offer more if desired.

Once you've completed these steps, click "Execute Order" and confirm the transaction in your wallet. Congratulations—you’ve successfully purchased a hypercert!
