### How to create a hypercert

Creating a hypercert is similar to creating an NFT on platforms like OpenSea or Zora. The form is available in our app <a href="https://app.hypercerts.org/hypercerts/new" target="_blank">here</a>. We recommend minting your first hypercert on testnet, which you can this <a href="https://testnet.hypercerts.org/hypercerts/new" target="_blank">here</a>.

In this article, we’ll walk through the steps one by one and explain exactly what you need to do to create your first hypercert.

### Who can create a hypercert?

Anyone doing work that is intended to have a positive impact can create a hypercert. Your hypercert can be as simple as "I did X on this date and want to claim all future impact from it".

It can also represent something more, such as a phase in an ongoing team project, an invention or discovery, a research publication, or an important software release.

Critically, if the work was done by more than one person, then each person should be listed as a contributor to the hypercert and approve the creation of the hypercert. The hypercert only represents the work of the contributors that are listed. For example if a research paper was written by 5 people, but only 3 are listed, then the hypercert also only represents their contributions, which is less than the full research artifact.

### What do I need to create a hypercert?

You will need to prepare all of the information required in the form builder (see [Step-by-step instructions for creating a hypercert](guide/minting.md) below). This includes important metadata, such as a description of the project and the dimensions of your impact claim, as well as a project artwork. You may also want to include an allowlist of wallets that are approved to claim one or more fractions of the hypercert.

In addition to the information regarding the hypercert itself, you’ll need a crypto wallet to mint your hypercert. “Minting” a hypercert is the process of writing an impact claim to the blockchain. This establishes its immutable record of authenticity and ownership.

Next, choose a blockchain on which to mint your hypercert. The hypercerts protocol is available on Optimism, Celo, Base, and Sepolia (testnet). Each of these blockchains has different gas fees associated with transactions on their networks.

Finally, go ahead and create your hypercert.

### How much does it cost to create a hypercert?

You will need enough Ethereum in your wallet to cover gas fees. In our simulations, the gas fee for minting a hypercert on Ethereum Mainnet ranged from 2,707,282 to 7,515,075 gwei (0.0027 to 0.0075 ETH). Minting costs are significantly cheaper on Optimism (i.e., below 0.0005 ETH or less than $1).

The protocol currently does not offer gas-free or "lazy" minting.
