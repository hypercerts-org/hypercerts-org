### Who can sell a hypercert?

Any creator of a hypercert can sell the hypercert or fractions thereof. At this point owners who received hypercert fractions from another creator can not sell or transfer the fractions.

### How can I sell a hypercert?

Selling hypercerts is a direct sales process: You can list a hypercert fraction you own for sale and set its price. Buyers will then be able to directly buy your hypercert fraction or a small fraction thereof.

In future releases, we will implement further strategies to sell hypercerts.

:::note
When you sell a fraction, a 1% fee will be allocated to the maintaneance and improvement of the hypercerts protocol. For projects for which this fee might be too high, we are happy to reimburse the fee. Please contact us at team@hypercerts.org

## Step-by-step instructions

Make sure your wallet is connected.

### Required steps
1. **Find hypercert:** Go to the hypercert you want to sell. You find all hypercerts you own on your profile (button on the top-right).
2. **Open listing pop-up:** In the section "Marketplace" on the individual view page of the hypercert you'll find the button "List for sale". When you click it, a pop-up will be shown.
3. **Select fraction:** If you own multiple fractions of the same hypercert, select the one you want to list for sale.
4. **Set the price:** The price you set is the total price for the whole fraction. The price for smaller fractions will be calculated proportionally. *Important: Make sure to select the correct token (ETH, USDC, or DAI). Buyers will have to use this token.*

If you don't need any advanced settings, click "Create listing", confirm it in your wallet, and buyers will be able to buy fractions of the hypercert you listed.

### Advanced settings

5. **Set the units offered:** If you don't want to sell the whole fraction, open the "Advanced Settings" and enter the units you want to offer for sale.
6. **Set minimum units per order:** If you want to require buyers to at least buy a minimum amount of the hypercert, you can define this amount here.
7. **Set maximum units per order:** If you want to require buyers to at least buy a maximum amount of the hypercert, you can define this amount here. *Note: Buyers could still make multiple transactions to purchase more of the hypercert.*
